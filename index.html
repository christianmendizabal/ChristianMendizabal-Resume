        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Christian Mendizabal. I was born in San Francisco and lived in the bay area my entire life. I received my high school diploma at De Anza High School in El Sobrante and moved on to further my education at University of California, Riverside.  Now that I have begun my college career, I have decided to major in Public Policy. Public Policy has interested me since highschools when I see so many traumatizing events happen with little to no change being done in government. Public Policy has shown me the different steps it takes for a policy to be implemented, the outcome of different policies, and the public's reaction to policies that we may think will help, but in the end don't. With furthering my career in Public Policy, I will make the change I have always seen that had needed to happen to make the life of my community better.
<br><br>

        I have currently been working for a non-profit organization that helps low-income first time home buyers find their dream home with the reassurance that they need. The Richmond Neighborhood Housing services is a group that works with low-income families in the steps of buying a home, especially in a housing market that is so high like in California. As a team, they have worked hard to strengthen low-income neighborhoods through teaching individuals of financial literacy. On their website they ‚ÄúOur Financial Counseling programs are designed to support and assist individuals in understanding and mastering the ‚Äúbasic‚Äù financial habits of budgeting, managing credit, and homeownership. We serve residents through education programs that include financial literacy, home loan programs, foreclosure prevention, and affordable rental counseling.‚Äù From this it is clear how the program is helping their community one household at a time. 
<br><br>

        Aside from working with a non-profit organization, I have a lot of experience working with the community at a family owned business. The business was a restaurant called Great American Hamburger and Pie. It was a small shop located in Point Richmond where their customers were the same regulars and everyone knew each other. Working here gave me the chance to see how small businesses run, what their needs from the government are, and how specific policies can affect them and their success throughout the years. Overall, I am still continuing to grow my career within policy, learning everyday about what i can do to better myself as a future policy maker, and how I can make it easier for the lives of those around the country. 
	I have also been working part time at a local coffee shop in my neighborhood.here I have learned how to connect with so many customers in their best and worst moments especially when they have not had their coffee. This has been an eye opening experience and it has made me realise that I love working with people. I have learned many different responsibilities like cash handling, labeling, cleaning tasks, and making it a great experience for our customers.
